See [deployment notes](#%EF%B8%8F%EF%B8%8Fdeployment) on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## 🔑 Prerequisites

Set up your development environment for building, running, and testing the Standup Raven.

### 👨‍💻 Obtaining Source

## 👨‍💻 Building

Once you have cloned the repo in the correct path - `$GOPATH/JoshLabs`, simply run `$ make dist` from the cloned repo.

This will produce three artifacts in `/dist` directory -

| Flavor  | Distribution |
|-------- | ------------ |
| Linux   | `mattermost-plugin-standup-raven-vx.y.z-linux-amd64.tar.gz` |
| MacOS   | `mattermost-plugin-standup-raven-vx.y.z-darwin-amd64.tar.gz` |

This will also install, Glide - the Go package manager.

## ⬇ Installing

Upload the plugin binary for your platform in Mattermost `System Console` > `Plugins (BETA)` > `Management`. 

# 💯 Running Tests

Following command will run all server and webapp tests -

    $ make test

# ⚙ Plugin Configurations

* `Bot Username`: User account to be used for sending all automated posts from. It's recommended to use a separate, bot account for the purpose.
* `Time Zone`: The time zone your team is working in. This is to make sure all datetimes you enter are interpreted in your timezone and not in server's.
* `Work Week Start`: Day on which your work week starts.
* `Work Week End`: Day on which your work week ends.

# ⁉ Troubleshooting

* **I submitted my standup but it's not showing up in the report.**

    Make sure you submitted the standup in the same channel as the report gets generated in.

* **I filled my standup report but had to make some changes to it. However, I'm seeing a blank standup form on opening it.**

    Make sure you are in the same channel as you originally filled your standup it.
    
* **I'm seeing "Standup not configured for this channel" message on opening the standup modal.**

    Make sure you are filling the standup in the right channel or that standup has been configured in the channel.
    
* **I'm seeing "You are not a part of this channel's standup" message on opening the standup modal.** 

    You are not the part of current channel's standup. Make sure you are filling standup in the right channel or that you were correctly added to the channel's standup.
    
* **I'm seeing "No members configured for this channel's standup" message on opening standup modal.**

    Make sure you've added some members to the channel's standup.
    
* **I'm seeing "Standup is disabled for this channel" message on opening standup modal.**

    The channel standup is disabled. Run `/standupconfig` and enable standup from the modal that opens. 

* **I think the plugin is awesome and super cool.**

    Hey, that's not a problem! It was designed that way 😎.
